# Task ID: 12
# Title: Configure ALB listeners with HTTPS/HTTP rules and SSL certificates
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a new HTTPS listener on port 443 to the TrialFinderV2 ALB with SSL certificates and routing rules, and update the existing port 80 listener with matching routing rules.
# Details:
1. Create HTTPS Listener on Port 443:
   - Use AWS CLI with to-dev-admin profile to add listener to existing ALB
   - Configure default SSL certificate: arn:aws:acm:us-east-2:615299752206:certificate/087ea311-2df9-4f71-afc1-b995a8576533
   - Add SNI certificates using aws elbv2 add-listener-certificates:
     * arn:aws:acm:us-east-2:615299752206:certificate/e9d39d56-c08c-4880-9c1a-da8361ee4f3e
     * arn:aws:acm:us-east-2:615299752206:certificate/087ea311-2df9-4f71-afc1-b995a8576533
   - Set SSL policy to ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01 or latest recommended

2. Configure Listener Rules for Port 443:
   - Rule 1: Path pattern '/app/*' forwards to TrialFinderTargetGroup
   - Rule 2: Default action forwards to TrialFinderTargetGroup
   - Set appropriate priority values (100 for path rule, default for catch-all)
   - Use aws elbv2 create-rule for each routing rule

3. Update Existing Port 80 Listener:
   - Retrieve current listener ARN using aws elbv2 describe-listeners
   - Delete existing rules if different from required configuration
   - Create matching rules: '/app/*' pattern and default both to TrialFinderTargetGroup
   - Ensure rule priorities are consistent between HTTP and HTTPS listeners

4. Validate Target Group Association:
   - Confirm TrialFinderTargetGroup exists and is healthy
   - Verify target group is in same VPC as ALB
   - Check target group health check configuration is appropriate for both listeners

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify HTTPS Listener Configuration:
   - Run aws elbv2 describe-listeners to confirm port 443 listener exists with correct SSL certificates
   - Test HTTPS connectivity: curl -k https://<alb-dns-name>/app/test and verify response
   - Validate SNI certificate configuration using openssl s_client -connect <alb-dns>:443 -servername <domain>

2. Test Routing Rules:
   - Test path rule: curl https://<alb-dns>/app/health should route to TrialFinderTargetGroup
   - Test default rule: curl https://<alb-dns>/other-path should route to TrialFinderTargetGroup
   - Repeat same tests for HTTP port 80 listener
   - Verify both listeners have identical routing behavior

3. SSL Certificate Validation:
   - Check certificate chain using SSL labs or similar tool
   - Verify all configured certificates are valid and not expired
   - Test certificate selection for different SNI hostnames

4. Target Group Health:
   - Run aws elbv2 describe-target-health to confirm targets are healthy
   - Monitor ALB access logs for successful request routing
   - Verify no 5xx errors in CloudWatch metrics for the ALB

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create HTTPS listener on port 443 with SSL certificate configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add a new HTTPS listener on port 443 to the existing TrialFinderV2 ALB with proper SSL certificate configuration and security policy
### Details:
Use AWS CLI with to-dev-admin profile to create HTTPS listener. Configure default SSL certificate (arn:aws:acm:us-east-2:615299752206:certificate/087ea311-2df9-4f71-afc1-b995a8576533). Set SSL security policy to ELBSecurityPolicy-TLS-1-2-2017-01 or latest recommended. Use aws elbv2 create-listener command with LoadBalancerArn, Port 443, Protocol HTTPS, and Certificates parameter.

## 2. Add SNI certificates to HTTPS listener for multi-domain support [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Configure additional SSL certificates using Server Name Indication (SNI) for the HTTPS listener to support multiple domains
### Details:
Use aws elbv2 add-listener-certificates command to add SNI certificates to the HTTPS listener created in previous step. Add certificates: arn:aws:acm:us-east-2:615299752206:certificate/e9d39d56-c08c-4880-9c1a-da8361ee4f3e and arn:aws:acm:us-east-2:615299752206:certificate/087ea311-2df9-4f71-afc1-b995a8576533. Retrieve listener ARN from previous step output.

## 3. Configure routing rules for HTTPS listener (port 443) [done]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Create routing rules for the HTTPS listener to forward traffic based on path patterns to the appropriate target group
### Details:
Create two routing rules using aws elbv2 create-rule: Rule 1 with priority 100 for path pattern '/app/*' forwarding to TrialFinderTargetGroup, and Rule 2 as default action (lowest priority) forwarding to TrialFinderTargetGroup. Use Type=forward action and retrieve target group ARN using aws elbv2 describe-target-groups.

## 4. Update existing HTTP listener (port 80) with matching routing rules [done]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Modify the existing port 80 HTTP listener to have matching routing rules consistent with the HTTPS listener configuration
### Details:
Retrieve existing HTTP listener ARN using aws elbv2 describe-listeners for port 80. Delete existing rules if they differ from required configuration using aws elbv2 delete-rule. Create matching rules with same priorities as HTTPS listener: '/app/*' pattern (priority 100) and default action both forwarding to TrialFinderTargetGroup using aws elbv2 create-rule.

## 5. Validate target group association and health check configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Verify that the TrialFinderTargetGroup exists, is properly configured, and can receive traffic from both HTTP and HTTPS listeners
### Details:
Use aws elbv2 describe-target-groups to confirm TrialFinderTargetGroup exists and retrieve its configuration. Verify target group is in same VPC as ALB using aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers. Check health check settings are appropriate for both listeners. Validate target registration and health status using aws elbv2 describe-target-health.
