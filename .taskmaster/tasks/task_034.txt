**Success Criteria:** Successful automated synchronization with <5 minute sync latency, 99.9% sync reliability, zero manual intervention for routine operations, and complete operational control through documented procedures.

**Dependencies:** External (Google Workspace Directory API, AWS IAM Identity Center), Internal (AppInfraCdkV1 infrastructure, Lake Formation groups), Technical (slashdevops/idp-scim-sync compatibility, CDK C# framework).

**Assumptions:** Stable infrastructure foundation, API compatibility maintenance, and proper service account provisioning capabilities.

# Test Strategy:
Verify CDK deployment succeeds across all environments. Test initial SCIM sync and validate all Lake Formation groups sync correctly. Verify each of the three disable methods work properly. Test environment variable controls and confirm AWS resources are created as expected. Validate troubleshooting procedures and test re-enabling synchronization. Ensure safe operational sequences prevent data inconsistencies. Validate all functional and non-functional requirements are met per PRD specifications.
