# Task ID: 8
# Title: Update ALB security group to only allow HTTPS traffic on port 443
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the existing ALB security group sg-0f145c092dfa6267b to enforce HTTPS-only traffic by removing HTTP (port 80) rules and updating the security group description to accurately reflect its purpose.
# Details:
1. Retrieve Current Security Group Configuration:
   - Use AWS CLI with to-dev-admin profile: aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-0f145c092dfa6267b --region us-east-2
   - Document all existing ingress and egress rules
   - Identify any HTTP (port 80) rules that need removal
   - Save current configuration for rollback purposes

2. Remove HTTP Ingress Rules:
   - Identify all ingress rules allowing port 80 traffic
   - Use aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress to remove each HTTP rule:
     * aws ec2 revoke-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-0f145c092dfa6267b --protocol tcp --port 80 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   - Remove any additional port 80 rules with different source configurations

3. Verify HTTPS Rules:
   - Ensure port 443 ingress rules exist from appropriate sources (0.0.0.0/0 for public ALB)
   - If missing, add HTTPS rule: aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-0f145c092dfa6267b --protocol tcp --port 443 --cidr 0.0.0.0/0
   - Confirm egress rules allow responses (typically all traffic egress is allowed)

4. Update Security Group Description:
   - Generate new description: "ALB security group - HTTPS only (port 443) for secure web traffic"
   - Update using: aws ec2 update-security-group-rule-descriptions-ingress --group-id sg-0f145c092dfa6267b
   - Include timestamp and change reason in description

5. Update CDK Code:
   - Locate security group definition in CDK stack (likely in TrialFinderV2Stack or WebApplicationStack)
   - Update ingress rules to only allow HTTPS:
     * securityGroup.addIngressRule(ec2.Peer.anyIpv4(), ec2.Port.tcp(443), 'Allow HTTPS traffic')
   - Remove any HTTP ingress rules from code
   - Update security group description in CDK constructor

6. Validate ALB Configuration:
   - Check ALB listeners to ensure only HTTPS listener exists
   - If HTTP listener exists, consider adding HTTP to HTTPS redirect before removal
   - Update target group health checks if currently using HTTP

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Security Group Rules:
   - Run aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-0f145c092dfa6267b to confirm only port 443 ingress exists
   - Validate no port 80 rules remain in the security group
   - Confirm security group description accurately reflects HTTPS-only configuration

2. Test ALB Accessibility:
   - Attempt HTTP connection to ALB DNS name - should fail or timeout
   - Test HTTPS connection to ALB DNS name - should succeed
   - Use curl commands: curl -I http://[alb-dns] (should fail) and curl -I https://[alb-dns] (should succeed)

3. Validate Application Functionality:
   - Ensure application remains accessible via HTTPS after changes
   - Test all application endpoints using HTTPS protocol
   - Monitor ALB target health to ensure no disruption to healthy targets

4. CDK Deployment Test:
   - Run cdk diff to review security group changes
   - Deploy updated CDK stack: cdk deploy TrialFinderV2Stack
   - Verify CloudFormation successfully updates security group without replacing it

5. Security Validation:
   - Run AWS Security Hub or trusted advisor checks on the ALB
   - Confirm compliance with HTTPS-only requirements
   - Document security improvement in change log
