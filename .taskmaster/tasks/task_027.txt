# Title: Implement Data Lake Storage Construct
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create C# CDK construct for S3 buckets with proper encryption and lifecycle policies
# Details:
Implement DataLakeStorageConstruct.cs with three buckets: raw data (thirdopinion-raw-{env}-{region}) with lifecycle rules, curated data (thirdopinion-curated-{env}-{region}) with versioning, and sensitive/PHI bucket for production only with KMS encryption and access logging. Configure appropriate block public access and removal policies.

# Test Strategy:
Deploy construct to dev environment, verify all three buckets created with correct configurations, test lifecycle rules and encryption settings
