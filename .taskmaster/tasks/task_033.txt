# Description: Add Lake Formation deployment to existing GitHub Actions deployment pipeline

Create or modify existing GitHub Actions workflow to include Lake Formation deployment steps. Add workflow_dispatch trigger for manual deployments, configure AWS credentials using existing OIDC roles, integrate CDK deployment commands, and add permission configuration and validation steps. Ensure compatibility with existing deployment structure.

# Test Strategy:
Test GitHub Actions workflow in dev environment first, verify OIDC authentication works, confirm deployment integrates with existing infrastructure, validate end-to-end deployment from GitHub
