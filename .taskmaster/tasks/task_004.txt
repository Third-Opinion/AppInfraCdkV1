# Task ID: 4
# Title: Deploy EnvironmentBaseStack with shared VPC infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Deploy the foundational networking infrastructure including VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, and security groups to support ALB and ECS deployments.
# Details:
1. Deploy EnvironmentBaseStack using CDK:
   - Execute 'cdk deploy EnvironmentBaseStack' using to-dev-admin profile
   - Verify stack deployment creates dev-shared-vpc-ue2-main VPC
   - Confirm public and private subnets are created across multiple AZs
   - Validate NAT gateways are provisioned for private subnet internet access
   - Ensure shared security groups are created with appropriate ingress/egress rules

2. AWS CLI Validation:
   - Use 'aws ec2 describe-vpcs' to verify VPC creation and configuration
   - Check subnet configuration with 'aws ec2 describe-subnets'
   - Validate NAT gateway deployment with 'aws ec2 describe-nat-gateways'
   - Inspect security groups using 'aws ec2 describe-security-groups'
   - Confirm route tables are properly configured for public/private routing

3. Infrastructure Verification:
   - Document VPC ID, subnet IDs, and security group IDs for reference
   - Verify internet gateway attachment and routing configuration
   - Confirm cross-AZ redundancy for high availability
   - Validate CIDR block allocation aligns with organizational standards

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify successful CDK deployment by checking AWS CloudFormation console for EnvironmentBaseStack completion status
2. Validate VPC infrastructure using AWS CLI commands to confirm all networking components are created
3. Test internet connectivity from private subnets through NAT gateways using EC2 instances or VPC endpoints
4. Confirm security group rules allow appropriate traffic flows for ALB and ECS services
5. Document all resource ARNs and IDs for use in dependent application infrastructure tasks
6. Perform cleanup test by destroying and redeploying stack to ensure reproducibility
