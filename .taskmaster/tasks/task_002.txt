# Task ID: 2
# Title: Enable Container Insights and enhanced observability for WebApplicationStack
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the CDK WebApplicationStack to integrate AWS Container Insights with CloudWatch monitoring, custom metrics, and comprehensive logging for enhanced observability of containerized applications.
# Details:
1. Modify the WebApplicationStack class to enable Container Insights on ECS clusters:
   - Add containerInsights: ecs.ContainerInsights.ENABLED to cluster configuration
   - Configure CloudWatch log groups with appropriate retention policies
   - Set up custom CloudWatch metrics for application performance monitoring

2. Implement comprehensive logging strategy:
   - Configure structured logging with JSON format for better parsing
   - Set up log aggregation using CloudWatch Logs
   - Add application-level metrics and tracing capabilities
   - Configure log retention policies based on environment (dev/prod)

3. Add monitoring and alerting infrastructure:
   - Create CloudWatch dashboards for key application metrics
   - Set up CloudWatch alarms for critical thresholds (CPU, memory, error rates)
   - Configure SNS topics for alert notifications
   - Implement custom metrics for business logic monitoring

4. Update CDK constructs to include:
   - Enhanced ECS task definitions with logging drivers
   - CloudWatch agent configuration for detailed metrics collection
   - X-Ray tracing integration for distributed tracing
   - Cost optimization through appropriate log retention and metric filtering

5. Environment-specific configuration:
   - Different monitoring levels for development vs production
   - Configurable alert thresholds based on environment
   - Resource tagging strategy for cost allocation and filtering

# Test Strategy:
1. Deploy the updated stack to development environment and verify Container Insights is enabled in ECS console
2. Validate CloudWatch metrics are being collected by checking the Container Insights dashboard
3. Test log aggregation by generating application logs and confirming they appear in CloudWatch Logs with correct formatting
4. Verify custom metrics are being published by triggering application events and checking CloudWatch metrics
5. Test alerting by intentionally triggering threshold breaches and confirming SNS notifications are sent
6. Validate X-Ray tracing by making application requests and reviewing trace data in X-Ray console
7. Check cost impact by reviewing CloudWatch billing and ensuring retention policies are applied correctly
8. Perform end-to-end monitoring test by simulating application failures and verifying detection through dashboards and alerts
