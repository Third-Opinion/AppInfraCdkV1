# Task ID: 18
# Title: Validate and fix production deployment for ALB and ECS stacks
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 16, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Identify and resolve issues causing CloudFormation stack failures for production ALB (arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-2:442042533707:stack/prod-tfv2-alb-ue2/f3eaed00-6121-11f0-a235-06ee954d8687) and ECS (arn:aws:cloudformation:us-east-2:442042533707:stack/prod-tfv2-ecs-ue2/89893210-6116-11f0-838d-0256c65c4237) stacks, fix them, and redeploy successfully.
# Details:
1. Investigate CloudFormation Stack Failures:
   - Use AWS CLI with to-prd-admin profile to examine stack events: aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name prod-tfv2-alb-ue2
   - Analyze ECS stack events: aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name prod-tfv2-ecs-ue2
   - Review stack resources and their failure reasons using aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources
   - Compare production stack configurations with working development stacks
   - Check for VPC, subnet, security group, or IAM role misconfigurations

2. Fix ALB Stack Issues:
   - Verify VPC name pattern lookup is working correctly for production environment (prod-shared-vpc-ue2-main)
   - Ensure security groups exist and have proper ingress/egress rules for HTTPS traffic
   - Validate SSL certificates are available in us-east-2 region for production domain
   - Check target group configurations and health check settings
   - Fix any IAM permission issues preventing ALB resource creation

3. Fix ECS Stack Issues:
   - Verify ECS cluster exists and is accessible in production environment
   - Check task definition configuration including container definitions and resource allocations
   - Validate ECS service role and task execution role permissions
   - Ensure container security groups allow proper traffic flow
   - Verify container image repositories are accessible from production account
   - Check Secrets Manager access permissions for production secrets

4. Deploy Fixed Stacks:
   - Deploy TrialFinderV2AlbStack first: cdk deploy TrialFinderV2AlbStack --profile to-prd-admin
   - Deploy TrialFinderV2EcsStack after ALB is healthy: cdk deploy TrialFinderV2EcsStack --profile to-prd-admin
   - Monitor deployment progress and validate no rollbacks occur
   - Verify all resources are created successfully

# Test Strategy:
1. Pre-deployment Validation:
   - Run cdk synth for both stacks to validate CloudFormation templates
   - Use AWS CLI to verify all prerequisite resources exist (VPC, subnets, security groups)
   - Confirm production environment configuration files have correct values

2. Post-deployment Testing:
   - Verify ALB stack deployment: aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name prod-tfv2-alb-ue2 --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus'
   - Confirm ECS stack deployment: aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name prod-tfv2-ecs-ue2 --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus'
   - Test ALB health and accessibility using production domain
   - Validate ECS service is running with healthy targets: aws ecs describe-services --cluster <prod-cluster> --services <service-name>
   - Check target group health: aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <prod-target-group-arn>
   - Verify application responds correctly through production ALB endpoint

3. Rollback Testing:
   - Ensure both stacks can be rolled back if issues arise
   - Test that rollback doesn't affect other production resources
