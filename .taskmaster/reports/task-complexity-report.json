			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Review and update documentation files including README.md",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation review and update process into specific subtasks covering: 1) Discovery and inventory of all markdown files, 2) Analysis of existing documentation structure and content, 3) Cross-referencing documentation with actual codebase state, 4) Updating README.md with accurate project information, 5) Ensuring consistency and formatting across all docs, and 6) Validation and testing of all documentation content including links and examples.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires comprehensive analysis across multiple files, understanding of the entire codebase structure, validation of technical accuracy, and coordination of updates across potentially numerous documentation files. The complexity stems from the need to cross-reference documentation with actual code, test examples, validate links, and ensure consistency throughout. The task involves both technical understanding and documentation best practices."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Enable Container Insights and enhanced observability for WebApplicationStack",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Container Insights and observability implementation into subtasks covering: 1) ECS cluster configuration with Container Insights enablement, 2) CloudWatch logging setup with retention policies and structured JSON formatting, 3) Custom metrics and X-Ray tracing integration, 4) CloudWatch dashboards and alarms creation with SNS notifications, 5) Environment-specific configurations and cost optimization strategies",
			"reasoning": "This task requires multiple AWS service integrations (ECS, CloudWatch, X-Ray, SNS) and involves both infrastructure changes and monitoring strategy implementation. The complexity comes from coordinating various observability components, environment-specific configurations, and ensuring proper cost optimization. Each major component (Container Insights, logging, metrics, dashboards, environment config) warrants its own subtask for proper implementation and testing."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create comprehensive ALB and ECS infrastructure for TrialFinderV2Stack",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the ALB and ECS infrastructure creation into subtasks: 1) AWS resource inspection and documentation of existing infrastructure, 2) ALB creation with security groups and S3 logging configuration, 3) ECS task definition and service configuration referencing WebApplicationStack cluster, 4) Security group setup for both ALB and ECS with proper ingress/egress rules, 5) JSON configuration management system implementation, 6) Integration testing and comprehensive documentation with TODO tracking",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex infrastructure task requiring careful coordination of multiple AWS resources across VPCs and services. It involves reverse-engineering existing resources, creating new networking components, and ensuring proper security configurations. The task spans ALB setup, ECS service creation, security group management, and configuration systems, each requiring detailed implementation. The dependency on existing infrastructure and need for careful testing adds to the complexity."
