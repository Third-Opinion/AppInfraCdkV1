		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Review and update documentation files including README.md",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation review and update process into specific subtasks covering: 1) Discovery and inventory of all markdown files, 2) Analysis of existing documentation structure and content, 3) Cross-referencing documentation with actual codebase state, 4) Updating README.md with accurate project information, 5) Ensuring consistency and formatting across all docs, and 6) Validation and testing of all documentation content including links and examples.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires comprehensive analysis across multiple files, understanding of the entire codebase structure, validation of technical accuracy, and coordination of updates across potentially numerous documentation files. The complexity stems from the need to cross-reference documentation with actual code, test examples, validate links, and ensure consistency throughout. The task involves both technical understanding and documentation best practices."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Enable Container Insights and enhanced observability for WebApplicationStack",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Container Insights implementation into subtasks covering: 1) ECS cluster configuration updates for Container Insights, 2) CloudWatch log group setup and retention policies, 3) Custom metrics and X-Ray tracing integration, 4) CloudWatch dashboards and alarms creation, 5) Environment-specific configuration and testing",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple AWS services integration (ECS, CloudWatch, X-Ray, SNS), requires both infrastructure changes and monitoring setup, and needs environment-specific configurations. The complexity comes from coordinating logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create comprehensive ALB and ECS infrastructure for TrialFinderV2Stack",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: 1) AWS resource inspection and documentation, 2) Security group configuration for ALB and ECS, 3) ALB creation with logging setup, 4) ECS task definition and service configuration, 5) JSON configuration management implementation, 6) Integration testing and documentation",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex infrastructure task requiring coordination of multiple AWS resources (ALB, ECS, VPC, security groups), integration with existing infrastructure, and careful security configuration. The task already has well-defined subtasks that appropriately break down the work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy EnvironmentBaseStack with shared VPC infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) CDK deployment execution and monitoring, 2) AWS resource validation using CLI commands, 3) Infrastructure documentation and verification of networking components",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward infrastructure deployment task using CDK. While it creates critical networking components, the actual implementation is relatively simple as it involves deploying a pre-defined stack and validating the results."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy WebApplicationStack with ECS cluster infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) CDK deployment of WebApplicationStack, 2) ECS cluster configuration with capacity providers, 3) Auto-scaling and IAM role setup, 4) Infrastructure validation and documentation",
			"reasoning": "This task involves deploying an ECS cluster with multiple configuration requirements including capacity providers, auto-scaling, and VPC integration. While more complex than basic stack deployment, it's less complex than the full ALB/ECS service setup in task 3."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Update IAM policies and roles for CDK deployment with proper permissions",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the IAM policy and role updates into discrete tasks: 1) Update dev-g-policy-g-gh-cdk-deploy policy with new permissions for self-management, 2) Create and configure new dev-cdk-role-ue2-github-actions role, 3) Add 'cdk' to application enum in codebase, 4) Remove CDKDeployPolicy references and replace with dev-g-policy-g-gh-cdk-deploy, 5) Update GitHub Actions workflows to use new role",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to critical IAM changes requiring careful permission scoping, multiple AWS CLI operations, GitHub Actions integration, and potential deployment impact. Involves policy versioning, role migration, and codebase updates across multiple systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement ECS task execution and task roles with Secrets Manager access",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement ECS IAM roles and Secrets Manager integration: 1) Create IAM policies for Secrets Manager access with environment-specific paths, 2) Configure ECS task execution role with KMS and Secrets Manager permissions, 3) Create environment-specific ECS task roles with resource constraints, 4) Set up test secrets in Secrets Manager following naming conventions, 5) Update CDK stack to use new roles and inject secrets as environment variables, 6) Implement and test IAM policy conditions for cross-environment access prevention",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity involving multiple IAM entities, secret management, KMS integration, environment separation, and CDK implementation. Requires careful security design with path-based access controls and extensive testing of permission boundaries."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Update ALB security group to only allow HTTPS traffic on port 443",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Modify ALB security group for HTTPS-only access: 1) Document current rules and remove HTTP (port 80) ingress rules from security group sg-0f145c092dfa6267b, 2) Update CDK code to reflect HTTPS-only configuration and security group description, 3) Validate ALB listeners and update health checks if needed",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity focused on security group rule modifications. Straightforward AWS CLI operations but requires careful validation to avoid service disruption and CDK code synchronization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Create VPC endpoints and security group for secure AWS service access",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Set up VPC endpoints for private AWS service connectivity: 1) Create and configure VPC endpoints security group with HTTPS ingress from VPC CIDR, 2) Create S3 gateway endpoint with route table associations, 3) Create interface endpoints for ECR (API and DKR) with DNS and security group configuration, 4) Create Secrets Manager interface endpoint and update CDK code to manage all endpoints",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to multiple endpoint types (gateway vs interface), DNS configuration, subnet associations, and integration with existing infrastructure. Requires understanding of VPC networking and private connectivity patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Create ECS container security group (ContainerFromAlbSecurityGroup) for all ECS services",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Configure ECS container security group with proper traffic rules: 1) Create security group with inbound rules from ALB and self-reference for container communication, 2) Configure outbound rules for internet access and VPC endpoint connectivity, 3) Update CDK code to use new security group in ECS task definitions",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving security group creation with specific ingress/egress rules. Requires coordination with ALB and VPC endpoint security groups but follows standard patterns for ECS container networking."
