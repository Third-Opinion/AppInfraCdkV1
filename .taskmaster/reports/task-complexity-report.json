		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Review and update documentation files including README.md",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the documentation review and update process into specific subtasks covering: 1) Discovery and inventory of all markdown files, 2) Analysis of existing documentation structure and content, 3) Cross-referencing documentation with actual codebase state, 4) Updating README.md with accurate project information, 5) Ensuring consistency and formatting across all docs, and 6) Validation and testing of all documentation content including links and examples.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires comprehensive analysis across multiple files, understanding of the entire codebase structure, validation of technical accuracy, and coordination of updates across potentially numerous documentation files. The complexity stems from the need to cross-reference documentation with actual code, test examples, validate links, and ensure consistency throughout. The task involves both technical understanding and documentation best practices."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Enable Container Insights and enhanced observability for WebApplicationStack",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Container Insights implementation into subtasks covering: 1) ECS cluster configuration updates for Container Insights, 2) CloudWatch log group setup and retention policies, 3) Custom metrics and X-Ray tracing integration, 4) CloudWatch dashboards and alarms creation, 5) Environment-specific configuration and testing",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple AWS services integration (ECS, CloudWatch, X-Ray, SNS), requires both infrastructure changes and monitoring setup, and needs environment-specific configurations. The complexity comes from coordinating logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting systems."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Create comprehensive ALB and ECS infrastructure for TrialFinderV2Stack",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: 1) AWS resource inspection and documentation, 2) Security group configuration for ALB and ECS, 3) ALB creation with logging setup, 4) ECS task definition and service configuration, 5) JSON configuration management implementation, 6) Integration testing and documentation",
			"reasoning": "This is a complex infrastructure task requiring coordination of multiple AWS resources (ALB, ECS, VPC, security groups), integration with existing infrastructure, and careful security configuration. The task already has well-defined subtasks that appropriately break down the work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy EnvironmentBaseStack with shared VPC infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) CDK deployment execution and monitoring, 2) AWS resource validation using CLI commands, 3) Infrastructure documentation and verification of networking components",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward infrastructure deployment task using CDK. While it creates critical networking components, the actual implementation is relatively simple as it involves deploying a pre-defined stack and validating the results."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy WebApplicationStack with ECS cluster infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) CDK deployment of WebApplicationStack, 2) ECS cluster configuration with capacity providers, 3) Auto-scaling and IAM role setup, 4) Infrastructure validation and documentation",
			"reasoning": "This task involves deploying an ECS cluster with multiple configuration requirements including capacity providers, auto-scaling, and VPC integration. While more complex than basic stack deployment, it's less complex than the full ALB/ECS service setup in task 3."
