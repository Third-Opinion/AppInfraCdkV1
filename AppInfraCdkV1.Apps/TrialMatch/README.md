# TrialMatch Application Architecture

## Overview

The TrialMatch application is a modern, cloud-native application built on AWS infrastructure using CDK (Cloud Development Kit). The application has been completely refactored from a monolithic architecture to a modular, service-oriented design that promotes maintainability, testability, and reusability.

## Architecture Transformation

### Before Refactoring
- **Monolithic Stack**: Single 1,731-line stack with mixed responsibilities
- **Tight Coupling**: All functionality tightly coupled in one class
- **Difficult Maintenance**: Changes in one area could affect others
- **Limited Testability**: Hard to test individual components
- **No Reusability**: Logic couldn't be shared between stacks

### After Refactoring
- **Main Stack**: Only 174 lines (90% reduction)
- **13 Specialized Services**: Each with a single responsibility
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **High Testability**: Each service can be tested independently
- **Maximum Reusability**: Services can be shared across different stacks

## Core Components

### 1. Main Stack (`TrialMatchEcsStack.cs`)
The orchestrator that coordinates all services and builders. It's responsible for:
- Initializing all services and builders
- Coordinating the deployment sequence
- Managing dependencies between components
- Providing the main entry point for CDK deployment

### 2. Service Layer
Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility:

#### SecretManager
- Manages AWS Secrets Manager operations
- Prevents deployment failures with existence checking

- Manages variable dependencies

#### HealthCheckBuilder
- Configures container health checks
- Sets up health check intervals and timeouts
- Manages health check commands and paths
- Ensures proper health check configuration

#### PortMappingBuilder
- Manages container port mappings
- Configures host and container ports
- Handles port protocol configuration
- Manages port binding strategies

#### IamRoleBuilder
- Creates IAM roles and policies
- Manages role permissions and trust relationships
- Handles cross-account role configuration
- Ensures proper security policies

#### SecurityGroupManager
- Manages security group configuration
- Sets up ingress and egress rules
- Handles security group dependencies
- Ensures proper network security

### 4. Configuration Layer
Manages application configuration and environment-specific settings:

#### ConfigurationLoader
- Loads configuration files
- Handles environment-specific overrides
- Validates configuration data
- Provides configuration access methods

#### ConfigurationModels
- Defines configuration data structures
- Ensures type safety for configuration
- Provides validation rules
- Manages configuration inheritance

### 5. Export Layer
Handles cross-stack resource sharing and output management:

#### StackOutputExporter
- Exports stack outputs
- Manages cross-stack references
- Handles output formatting
- Ensures proper output validation

### 6. Manager Layer
Provides specialized management capabilities:

#### EnvironmentVariableManager
- Manages environment variable lifecycle
- Handles variable validation
- Manages variable dependencies
- Ensures proper variable formatting

## Deployment Flow

1. **Configuration Loading**: Load environment-specific configuration
2. **Service Initialization**: Initialize all services with configuration
3. **Resource Creation**: Create AWS resources in dependency order
4. **Service Configuration**: Configure services with created resources
5. **Output Export**: Export resource references for other stacks
6. **Validation**: Validate all resources are properly configured
