# Lake Formation Scripts Status

## Overview
This document tracks the status and purpose of each Lake Formation script after CDK implementation.

## Directory Organization

Scripts are now organized into two categories:
- **run-once/** - One-time setup scripts for initial configuration
- **Main directory** - Regular use scripts for validation and testing

## Script Status

### ✅ KEEP - One-Time Setup Scripts (run-once/)
These scripts manage AWS Identity Center integration and initial setup, which is NOT handled by CDK:

1. **run-once/setup-lakeformation-identity-center-dev.sh**
   - Purpose: Links dev Lake Formation to production Identity Center
   - Status: ACTIVE - One-time setup for Identity Center
   - Note: Identity Center configuration is CLI-based, not CDK

2. **run-once/setup-lakeformation-identity-center-prod.sh**
   - Purpose: Configures production Lake Formation with Identity Center
   - Status: ACTIVE - One-time production setup
   - Note: Includes safety measures for production changes

3. **run-once/check-prerequisites.sh**
   - Purpose: Validates Identity Center setup before integration
   - Status: ACTIVE - Run before initial setup
   - Note: Checks for required Google Workspace groups

4. **run-once/deploy-data-lake.sh**
   - Purpose: Orchestrates CDK deployment of Lake Formation
   - Status: UPDATED - Fixed CDK paths, but GitHub Actions preferred
   - Note: Consider using GitHub Actions workflows instead

### ✅ KEEP - Regular Use Scripts
These scripts are for ongoing validation and testing:

1. **verify-integration.sh**
   - Purpose: Verifies Identity Center integration is working
   - Status: ACTIVE - Useful for troubleshooting

2. **test-integration.sh**
   - Purpose: Tests the complete integration
   - Status: ACTIVE - Validation testing

### ✅ KEEP - Configuration Files (run-once/)
1. **run-once/lake-formation-identity-center-config-dev.json**
   - Purpose: Stores dev environment Identity Center configuration
   - Status: ACTIVE - Generated by setup scripts

2. **run-once/lake-formation-identity-center-config-prod.json**
   - Purpose: Stores production Identity Center configuration
   - Status: ACTIVE - Generated by setup scripts

### ✅ KEEP - Documentation
1. **README.md**
   - Purpose: Documents the Identity Center integration process
   - Status: ACTIVE - Important documentation

2. **CROSS_ACCOUNT_ARCHITECTURE.md**
   - Purpose: Explains cross-account Identity Center architecture
   - Status: ACTIVE - Architecture documentation

### ✅ KEEP - Backups
1. **backups/** directory
   - Purpose: Contains backups of Lake Formation configurations
   - Status: ACTIVE - Important for disaster recovery

## Recommendations

1. **Keep all Identity Center scripts** - These handle functionality not covered by CDK
2. **Consider deprecating deploy-data-lake.sh** - GitHub Actions workflows now handle deployment
3. **Keep all configuration and documentation** - Essential for operations and troubleshooting

## Migration Notes

The CDK implementation handles:
- Lake Formation infrastructure (S3 buckets, databases, tables)
- IAM roles and policies
- Lake Formation permissions

The scripts still handle:
- AWS Identity Center integration
- Google Workspace group synchronization
- Cross-account Identity Center configuration
- Manual validation and testing

## Usage After CDK Implementation

1. Use GitHub Actions for Lake Formation deployment (infrastructure)
2. Use these scripts for Identity Center setup (identity management)
3. The two systems work together: CDK creates resources, scripts configure identity
